# Project Name
Guess Who?

We were to create a site using Javascript, HTML and CSS that works about the same as the old board game "Guess Who?"

With Javascript randomizing a secret person at the loading of the site. And then it's up to the player to narrow down the different people by guessing the attributes untill you are ready to
make a guess on what person you think it is. 

## The problem

I had major issues not knowing where to start really, and how to formulate the questions I had to get the answers I sought. Luckily my teammates were fantastic in helping out and share
the issues themselves had and how they solved it.
